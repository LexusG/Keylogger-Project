# Keylogger-Project
I've developed a Python-based keylogger application as a means to grasp Python's principles and delve into the intricacies of how a keylogger works.


Current Functionalities Includes
- Keylogging 
- Microphone Recording
- Screenshot
- Logging Computer Information
- Logging Clipboard Data
  


Still a work in Progress.
